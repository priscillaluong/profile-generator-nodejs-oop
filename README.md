## Application Description

A Node.js command line application that takes in information about employeees in a team and generates a HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person (name, ID, email, job title etc.) Unit tests have also been written to ensure code is maintainable. 

[Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) has been used for running the unit tests and [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) for collecting input from the user.

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```
